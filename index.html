          More Love By Rebelution

          <br />
          "Because you're living an illusion I can't wait till it hits you
          Recollection, your misconception Obsessed, you say the green is
          success Well, material gain causes serious stress More love Because
          you're living an illusion Wake up now yes you're living in confusion
          You're not a scholar You're a waste of a teacher Preach the dollars
          You're a waste of a preacher"
